### More on CSS Classes
#### Multiple CSS rules Applied
```html
<div class= "class1 class2"></div>
```
#### `a` element with class `active`
```html
<a href="#" class="active">
```
#### Try not use `id` for styling
- if you can you `class`, just use `class`
- `id` can be used as the `linking` within a page
#### Link within a page
- id is not only for styling, also for linking within a page
```html
<div id="link1">
```
- Click this on will jump to link1 element
```html
<a href="#link1">Link 1</a>
```
- Or you can type this in your browser
```
http://localhost:3000#link1
```
### !important
- Try not use important as possible
- This is hard-code, not recommended.
